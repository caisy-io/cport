# Export Flow

Here's the process described in Markdown format:

1. **Import Tags**

   - Import tags first because content types might depend on them.

2. **Import Blueprints**

   - Import blueprints, which include:
     - Content types
     - Content type groups
     - Content type fields
     - Content type tags

3. **Import Locales**

   - After importing blueprints, import the locales.

4. **Import Content Entries**

   - Once the locales are imported, import the content entries.

5. **Download and Store Assets**
   - After importing content entries, download the assets.
   - Place the downloaded assets into the designated assets folder.
   - Store the reference to the assets' location.

By following this order of importing tags, blueprints, locales, content entries, and finally downloading and storing assets, the process ensures that all the necessary dependencies and references are in place for the content to be properly structured and linked.
